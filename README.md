# ms-comp-challenge-3

This project was very complicated so I started designing with mobile in mind - first figuring out how all of the sections would break down onto small screens and then adding the content inside the sections. I thought it was important to maintain the size of the side navigation box so it didn't shrink too much and I also kept the circle graphs all the same size for readability. 

There was no room for many of the links and icons on mobile screens so I created several media queries that hid them as they reached different breakpoints an added icons or a "more" tab on the links to demonstrate that additional content is there.
